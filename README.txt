This game was developed for Comsci 437 at Iowa State

My game features a terrain scene and a board scene; in the terrain scene, the player must navigate the terrain
and avoid enemies (shaded red because of time constraints) Enemies follow a state machine and will chase you if
you get close enough. Otherwise, enemies roam the map looking for you. While on the terrain, use 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'
to move, and 'C' to sprint. You will see your Health and Stamina bar in the top left; run out of health and you lose

The goal of the terrain scene is to find the exit gates; which are guarded by a tough enemy. Pick the gate with green
trim to face the easiest opponent in the exit game (checkers); yellow is medium difficulty and red is hard. If you
win in checkers, you win the game.
